The traditional image of “Early Buddhism” is characterized by a striking individuality and the lack of 
a social consciousness. Among the earliest attested practitioners of the late fourth century BC, the “forest 
śramaṇas” were solitary, but the “town śramaṇas” were involved in helping people, and stayed overnight 
in patrons’ houses. Nevertheless, there was no Buddhist community like the later Saṃgha, and śramaṇas 
were not monks. It was still un-organized non-monastic Buddhism; monasteries and monks (bhikṣus) did 
not yet exist (Beckwith 2015). 
Then, in the first to second centuries CE, the developed Buddhist monastery appears in Kushan northwestern
India as well as in North China, a culture just outside the sphere of influence of the Kushan 
Empire, accompanied by written texts and historical references. It is “Normative Buddhism” – fully 
developed organized later Buddhism, with the triratna, monks, devotion to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, 
karma, rebirth, etc.: more or less the entire tradition known to us, except for the Vinayas, all of which 
have been shown to date to the fifth century CE (Schopen 2004:94). 
The central institution of Normative Buddhist culture is the Buddhist monastery, or vihāra. The 
importance of the monastery for a society dominated by Buddhism is so crucial that we must spend a few 
minutes on what exactly the early monastery was, and what it was called. The early Buddhist monastery 
first appears as a completely developed complex thing, with many special features: 
¨ Its most important building, the raison d’être of the monastery as a whole, has a highly distinctive 
architectual design known as the “cloister plan”. In Buddhist archaeological contexts it is known as the 
“vihāra plan”. It was designed to house a medium-sized group of regimented monks in identical, tiny 
cells – the opposite of Early Buddhist individuality. The standard plan consists of a rectangular structure 
with a heavy exterior wall and one entrance. From the outside it is easily mistaken for a fort. The interior 
is dominated by an open rectangular courtyard (in some cases occupied largely by a rectangular pool) 
surrounded by a colonnaded or arcaded walkway or “veranda”. The entire structure between the veranda 
and the exterior wall, all the way around except for the lone entryway, consists of more or less identical 
cells, each housing one monk. A kitchen and other functional rooms are also attached to the cloister. 
Evidently because of the central importance of the cloister building, the vihāra proper, the monastery 
complex as a whole early came to be called a vihāra in many languages. 
¨ It was a particular kind of legal entity – an endowed, tax-free institution with inheritable 
ownership (Schopen 2004: 219-259; Van Bladel 2010). 
¨ It was the locus for religious veneration of Buddhist relics in an associated stūpa (a Buddhist 
caitya or ‘reliquary’) that sometimes occupied part of the vihāra courtyard. 
¨ The vihāra was also the first college, the direct ancestor – via the medieval Islamic madrasa1 – of 
our modern university, as recently shown in detail.2 
 The monastery was thus not a “generic” institution or architectural form. The residential quarter of all 
early Buddhist monasteries found so far follows the same unique plan, the “cloister plan” or vihāra plan, 
which is highly distinctive and can hardly be confused with anything else. Its later Central Asian form, 
the “four-īwān” plan, dating from about the fifth or sixth century on, is best known from the site of
