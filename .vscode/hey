hey guys this is a text file
today i want to tell you how to use this poor computer
first we need to create a startup to open the belly on the bottom of this laptop
and then poor some honey on the top
and then add some salt and vinegar to stimulate the fantastic odor
at last the computer will explode into pieces
finally the pieces will get back together
and then a white light will shine through the screen
so every time we start up a computer
we need to wear special glasses in order not to get blind
the eye glasses are made from sand
which is produced through three steps
baking, melting, and reshaping
and then the glass will reserruct in huge wild fires
found that list[-1] was accesible
There are many errors around the corner
we need to lift our shoes, be silent and untouchable and tight our nerves
how to comment on whole paragrphs, I am very curious about it
I've done the list already, so we should move to the next place with a sieady pace
green means disgusting errors and mysterious mistakes
but as mistakes accompany us,it makes us stronger
as someone once said that'what did not kill you makes you stronger'
the olympics approaches
the slogan of the olmpics is higher, faster, stronger every athelete tries his best to accomplish this seemingly far-reaching goal that once seems out of their ability
i can't do this is such an excuse
if we believe we can, despite the tornado or earthquake,
i believe we can reach the peak of the mountains and touch the twinkling stars hanging on the curtain of the deep blue sky
this is what i want to say
what do you think bro
TAB is an important one
the time is approaching noon, i'm gotta to eat some delicious working meals to statisfy my starving stomach 
i've found something special
if you just give the two lists a '=', the two lists will become one
this is such an astonishing thing
so we need to do like this:rubbish=game[:]
program, magic!
i finally understand why father and his colleagues go out to eat some food, it's because the canteen food is really nasty, such as what i can eat today is only chicken legs
ah, although yesterday i ate seafood in a nearby restaurant just now, i began to miss the splendid cooking and flavor that it brought to my taste bulds
how sorrowful it is!
i am going to get some sleep for my afternoon studies.goodbye
in purple gold company, at noon the lights will be closed at 12:30 and be opened at 13:30, in other words, the employees here will have a good noon rest for an hour, which i think is reasonable and it reflects an old saying that 'sharpening the knife dosen't postpone chopping down trees.'
deep dark fatansy is coming
