7/15 Monday
hey guys this is a text file
today i want to tell you how to use this poor computer
first we need to create a startup to open the belly on the bottom of this laptop
and then poor some honey on the top
and then add some salt and vinegar to stimulate the fantastic odor
at last the computer will explode into pieces
finally the pieces will get back together
and then a white light will shine through the screen
so every time we start up a computer
we need to wear special glasses in order not to get blind
dinner was mactaculous



7/16 Tuseday
the eye glasses are made from sand
which is produced through three steps
baking, melting, and reshaping
and then the glass will reserruct in huge wild fires
found that list[-1] was accesible
There are many errors around the corner
we need to lift our shoes, be silent and untouchable and tight our nerves
how to comment on whole paragrphs, I am very curious about it
I've done the list already, so we should move to the next place with a sieady pace
green means disgusting errors and mysterious mistakes
but as mistakes accompany us,it makes us stronger
as someone once said that'what did not kill you makes you stronger'
the olympics approaches
the slogan of the olmpics is higher, faster, stronger every athelete tries his best to accomplish this seemingly far-reaching goal that once seems out of their ability
i can't do this is such an excuse
if we believe we can, despite the tornado or earthquake,
i believe we can reach the peak of the mountains and touch the twinkling stars hanging on the curtain of the deep blue sky
this is what i want to say
what do you think bro
TAB is an important one
the time is approaching noon, i'm gotta to eat some delicious working meals to statisfy my starving stomach 
i've found something special
if you just give the two lists a '=', the two lists will become one
this is such an astonishing thing
so we need to do like this:rubbish=game[:]
program, magic!
i finally understand why father and his colleagues go out to eat some food, it's because the canteen food is really nasty, such as what i can eat today is only chicken legs
ah, although yesterday i ate seafood in a nearby restaurant just now, i began to miss the splendid cooking and flavor that it brought to my taste bulds
how sorrowful it is!
i am going to get some sleep for my afternoon studies.goodbye
in purple gold company, at noon the lights will be closed at 12:30 and be opened at 13:30, in other words, the employees here will have a good noon rest for an hour, which i think is reasonable and it reflects an old saying that 'sharpening the knife dosen't postpone chopping down trees.'
deep dark fatansy is coming
i also turn for help to the website, it told me how to use the random library, which makes my knowledge skyrocket, i also want to introduce some of themc
why operation start can't be deleted?
gambling is risky, this form had better disappear on earth 
what web program do you want to establish? https:/
i finally done today's work what do you think
the dinner was really delicious, especially the abalone , fried little yellow fish and roasted mutton with red wine and black pepper sauce

7/17 Wednesday
i foung that the canteen here was really nasty
so i decided to change this situation
and leave some proposals
my dad told me that the title was too attacking that l changed it into a more tenderer one
the chairman of the association party is going to talk with me
should i feel honored ,afraid and trembling
i am a little confused
but intelligent people once said 'when there is a will, there is a way', mabey i don't need to be like this
yhe dictionary can do such nesting, which really surprises me a lot
i have overreached? are you kidding me
at today's afternoon, after i've slept a noon sleep , i had a wechat call with the ZiJing Party vice chairman, we had a thorogh discussion about how to improve the food in the canteen
i thought of many ways, but they are mostly rejected subject to this or that reason
we only reached an agreement on spot checking whether they are using Prefabricated dishes, if they do do the vice chairman will go and argue with them, a saint once said 'Seeing is believing, but hearing is not.'
he also said that we don't need to investigate on employees because the canteen manager knows all about the employees' appetite after one or two months
but one thing l really learnt today was every thing is made up of multiple aspects.
every time we made a significant decision, these can't be neglected
i then told this thing to my father, my father thought mabey releasing some satisfaction surveys is appropriate, because it could lay some pressure on the canteen
mabey i'm a bit irritable, next time i will think more
my father sang highly of me while telling me the staff on the spot may meet with me sonner or later
unveil the darkness is my duty
i've tried food,places,colors
oh fruits and pets and animals!@you that's a good idea
how tatlented, gifted it is!w
i finally overcame the ifs and inputs, now i am ging to reach higher defs, wait me!
