7/15 Monday
hey guys this is a text file
today i want to tell you how to use this poor computer
first we need to create a startup to open the belly on the bottom of this laptop
and then poor some honey on the top
and then add some salt and vinegar to stimulate the fantastic odor
at last the computer will explode into pieces
finally the pieces will get back together
and then a white light will shine through the screen
so every time we start up a computer
we need to wear special glasses in order not to get blind
dinner was mactaculous



7/16 Tuseday
the eye glasses are made from sand
which is produced through three steps
baking, melting, and reshaping
and then the glass will reserruct in huge wild fires
found that list[-1] was accesible
There are many errors around the corner
we need to lift our shoes, be silent and untouchable and tight our nerves
how to comment on whole paragrphs, I am very curious about it
I've done the list already, so we should move to the next place with a sieady pace
green means disgusting errors and mysterious mistakes
but as mistakes accompany us,it makes us stronger
as someone once said that'what did not kill you makes you stronger'
the olympics approaches
the slogan of the olmpics is higher, faster, stronger every athelete tries his best to accomplish this seemingly far-reaching goal that once seems out of their ability
i can't do this is such an excuse
if we believe we can, despite the tornado or earthquake,
i believe we can reach the peak of the mountains and touch the twinkling stars hanging on the curtain of the deep blue sky
this is what i want to say
what do you think bro
TAB is an important one
the time is approaching noon, i'm gotta to eat some delicious working meals to statisfy my starving stomach 
i've found something special
if you just give the two lists a '=', the two lists will become one
this is such an astonishing thing
so we need to do like this:rubbish=game[:]
program, magic!
i finally understand why father and his colleagues go out to eat some food, it's because the canteen food is really nasty, such as what i can eat today is only chicken legs
ah, although yesterday i ate seafood in a nearby restaurant just now, i began to miss the splendid cooking and flavor that it brought to my taste bulds
how sorrowful it is!
i am going to get some sleep for my afternoon studies.goodbye
in purple gold company, at noon the lights will be closed at 12:30 and be opened at 13:30, in other words, the employees here will have a good noon rest for an hour, which i think is reasonable and it reflects an old saying that 'sharpening the knife dosen't postpone chopping down trees.'
deep dark fatansy is coming
i also turn for help to the website, it told me how to use the random library, which makes my knowledge skyrocket, i also want to introduce some of themc
why operation start can't be deleted?
gambling is risky, this form had better disappear on earth 
what web program do you want to establish? https:/
i finally done today's work what do you think
the dinner was really delicious, especially the abalone , fried little yellow fish and roasted mutton with red wine and black pepper sauce



7/17 Wednesday
i foung that the canteen here was really nasty
so i decided to change this situation
and leave some proposals
my dad told me that the title was too attacking that l changed it into a more tenderer one
the chairman of the association party is going to talk with me
should i feel honored ,afraid and trembling
i am a little confused 
but intelligent people once said 'when there is a will, there is a way', mabey i don't need to be like this
the dictionary can do such nesting, which really surprises me a lot
i have overreached? are you kidding me
at today's afternoon, after i've slept a noon sleep , i had a wechat call with the ZiJing Party vice chairman, we had a thorogh discussion about how to improve the food in the canteen
i thought of many ways, but they are mostly rejected subject to this or that reason
we only reached an agreement on spot checking whether they are using Prefabricated dishes, if they do do the vice chairman will go and argue with them, a saint once said 'Seeing is believing, but hearing is not.'
he also said that we don't need to investigate on employees because the canteen manager knows all about the employees' appetite after one or two months
but one thing l really learnt today was every thing is made up of multiple aspects.
every time we made a significant decision, these can't be neglected
i then told this thing to my father, my father thought mabey releasing some satisfaction surveys is appropriate, because it could lay some pressure on the canteen
mabey i'm a bit irritable, next time i will think more
my father sang highly of me while telling me the staff on the spot may meet with me sonner or later
unveil the darkness is my duty
i've tried food,places,colors
oh fruits and pets and animals!@you that's a good idea
how tatlented, gifted it is!w
i finally overcame the ifs and inputs, now i am ging to reach higher defs, wait me!



7/18 Thursday
on  today's morning, we've packed up badminton bats and shoes becuase i and some big brothers and sisters will play badminton tonight, but i had not played badminton for aperiod of time, so now i am excited and a bit anxious
i today will study deeper on defs this is a little sophsticated which means complex
that the error was broadcasted in Chinese was what i had first met
i felt sleepy, please forgive me for going to the bed (bubbles floating in the air)
yesterday i watched the video about joe biden and donald trump arguing on TV live,
as they have both been a president for four years, they can't boast about how can they make the united states of America great again, instead, they revealed the other person black things, hoping to beat their opponent in this reasonable way
they discussed topics on economy, absorption, finance, government, military, posion, guns, immigrants, inflatation and jobs and social security
it was such a disaster, the commentator said
but as an afternoon milk tea with cream topping, it was just fine 
we are all fun people, after all
i've seen telesia and telexisi at the sakazi rougelike, it really
it was described on the book that tuples can be created in def by one star, whilw dictionaries need two stars
the food in the canteen seems to get better and better each day, which is a surprise to me, today i ate corns, cabbage with meat, potato with meat, goulash, shrimp cake, watermelon and green beans soup, which i think is to my taste.
hope the canteen a bright future
oh and my dad actually guessed that i have slept in the room next to him for fifty minutes. how can he
I got up at 13:39, i am going to place all my strengths in today's afternoon work
the book said that one of the prgrammer's target is to complete missions using easy codes, at the meantime, functions are helpful for them to do this
when you edit some codes and ensure that they can run properly, you can move to the next sector instead of sparing your energy and inspecting them again and again 
we can also use these codes multiple times in a done project
let us move to the next region: class(category)
Spain has done a feat that she has won seven matches in a row, and it's so unprecedented that no other country had ever done before in the Europe Cup
then i played badminton with other three employees
although they are moderate, they played quite well, really.
at last, Aldu suggested that we should go to have some midnight snacks, but i opposed to this idea because it would not only make your efforts wasted, but also makes you fatter
then i was sent back home



7/19 Friday
at this morning, i inquired some questions about 'class'  to Qiu, he answered them patiently, like i do not really understand the advantage of this code and so on
warm tips: i really like the red tea that my father made
the adjustment of files can only be put into use afier being closed and saved
and if there are outcomes in the works, it will be printed by importing, because import means running the whole repository
it's two thirty in the afternoon, and here is going to hold a Zijin Intelligence Control third anniversary party, which starts at three o'clock
i saw there are a lot of colorful balloons floating in the air, coco colas being placed on tables, everyone has a smile on his face, the atmosphere was full of happiness and joy, so let's  wait and show our expectation to this great event.
a woman said that all the staffs should stand in a row before three in order to accept the inspection of their leader, the hstess said that standing chaotically is just ok



8/5 Monday
Finally, i got back from Tibet, which is such an exciting trip
i will continue to learn Python 
today i fled out of the basics, i am going to learn how to use the database, really exciting
recalling the days in Tibet, it was really amazing and unforgettable
there are roasted beef, mutton shashlik, Saute Spicy Chicken and dog fish
vegetables are Garlic Sprout Shredded Meat and tomato with eggs
today's lunch is just so so
i am going to step into the next stage of coding, which means combining coding with realistic tools
in my perspective, this encourages me to look straight up and speed forward
i asked my teacher about how to adjust the grants for users, which is a necessary skill for an administrator
the swimming races had already ended, and China has won a lot of medals
we are all excited and happy to see this glorious event
hope China will build sportsmanship and put all strengths on propagating all people sports in the mainland
i do not know what to do, so i will continue to build a spacecraft vresus aliens game, according to the latter of the programming book
first, i should install pygame as a setter
we use clock to solve the problem of inconsisitence frame rate and set that number at a line of sixty
my passion just rushed to me, but when i realized that even if i write the same as what was writen in this book, the program can't just work a bit, which made me feel very confused and puzzled
is the guidiance on  the book wrong? or am i wrong?
i just want to depict various shapes on my computer's screen
anyway, this is not something strongly required and i can not do it is the sky that curses me
a low birth, an inferior kindergarten, a bilingual primary school, a well-known middle school, a painstaking high school and , through the college entrance examination, i was finally committed by shanghai science and technology college
like battleplan once said 'like a phoneix/revive from the ashes' i hope i can do that one day



8/6 Tuseday
today i am moving forward
i would like to combine database with python today, which will let the primarily unrelated two grow connections with each other
learn two new libraries, which benefits me a lot 
i found an article about some replacements of english words, which fuels my composition with sparkling idioms
i see what is a fastapi.
fastapi is a internet framework, contrast to the real application framework on mobile phones and computers
it guides the websites, as a loyal servant, to operate at a specific mode and arrange schedules one after another
fastapi has many advantages, including perfect function, quick coding, rare bugs, direct screen, easy using experience, short coding requirements, strong and interactive  over other rivals
i have screenshoted a photo and moved it to the suitcase 'doctor/internet'
i and my teacher work together to dash through many difficulties, it was such a different expreience like we are just warriors being stuck in a trap and we tried every means to pull ourselves out and gain freedom again
and it struck me that if i want to use a server, i must first feed some related data into it so it could run soomthly
oh the file name can't be editted like there are spaces in it
the things on the internet is such a puzzling thing that I asked tens of hundreds of questions before i finally understood the operating mechanism of fastapi
oh i am going to be off work, see you tomorrow



8/7 Wednesday
Hi everybody, i am back to work
although i don't think start to work in the company at nine am and go back home at seventeen in the afternoon, but it seems that my papa regarded it as a severe problem, which i sigh that what a miserable working machine!
taday i am going to discover the mysteries in access to building an internet page 
in spite of just finishing half of the old learning thing to default value, he thinks thqt i may completed the new one
the constant explorations of this huge giant evidently delay my progress, which there are a lot of concepts that i haven't heard ever before
so take a deep breathe and tell yourself that you can arrive at the other side ultimately
where am i ? who am i ? 
my teacher explains that class means we defined a commodity with its name, detail, width and height
Also, this class doesn't need to be initialized
on the other side, we need to launch a website by html, and users could input information about the goods on it, and it will automatically transport to background, stored in servers
when the user need to modify descriptions of their groceries, they should visit the upgrade website to execute this process
the medals of the USA has surpassed us
What a grey day! what an overturn it is
QHC's technique of eliminating water has astonished me
the account of peach hear deep is so African that he didn't even harvested a six star operator after fifty seven polls.
i have got another epic mystery box this dawn, which makes my nearly chaotic brain turn crystal clear again 
as i have overcome the mountain range of jsons, my teacher, named hill lush dragon, let me try to construct a brand new , high end website by myself, i will spare no effort to conqure this challenge
today i am going to study the basic of web development, which is a new field for me
i used an artificial intelligence software, which really makes me surprised due to its high quality and quantity of service
i am going to be off work, please pray for next time's encounter



8/8 Thursday
i am back to work at nine zero nine under the air conditioner
today nobody will make rock tea for me, so i added some mineral water into my tea pot in order to get more diluted tea
my daddy advised that i had better get back to my seat to set up  at thirteen thirty, but today i got back at fourteen eighteen, which you have never thought about it
i advanced my sand continent alorgrithm into sixty second day, which i didn't hang myself on a single tree, and after a few times of trail and error, i finally beat the boss and got into white water and green oasis, i will propel towards a huger and more challenging task this night
